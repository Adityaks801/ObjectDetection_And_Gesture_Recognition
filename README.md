Object Detection and Gesture Recognition
This project implements real-time Object Detection using YOLOv5 and Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe Hands, powered by OpenCV. The application processes video feeds from a webcam to detect objects and recognize gestures, providing an interactive way to toggle between the two modes.

Features
